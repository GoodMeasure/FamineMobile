Mycael - (Egypt, -> Turkey) - A cryptic, partriarchal, and superstitious colonial region.

Mycael is by far the most diverse of the starting areas, and is a blend of desert, swamp,
and mediterranean geographies, the northern colonies sporting a mediterranean climate,
a more desertous one in the west, and a marshland to the east. The Mycaelops originated
in the western region, and maintained a sense of solidarity through early development of
their civilization. This led to powerful bodies being established and maintained early.
By now, a central ruling partriarchy is in place, and has made appeals to higher powers.
The gods looked favorably upon the rulers, but each sought to pull the people towards their
devotion.

Crusades in the name of various gods took place, and colonies sprung up in the place of
barbarian encampments in the southern and eastern regions of the Mycaelop Empire. The dark
gods commanded a foothold in what was the northern fringe of Onidewa, and the holy gods
decreed encampments and temples made across the " sea, on the southern coasts of ",
in order to spread the faith in those barbarian regions.

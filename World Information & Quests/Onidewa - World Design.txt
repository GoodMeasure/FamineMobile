Predominantly deep and rusty oranges are seen 
in the deltas and marshes of Onidewa. Red clay from the
canyons in the central mountain range of the region make
bodies of water here murky red, orange, or brown hues.
Plants are deep red or dark brown, and vegetation is thick
and full enough that litle light is let through the canopy
above the swamps.

Enemies here are stealthy agents or thieves,
lone bounty hunters and pirates. Unafilliated thieves wear
dark rough rags and blend into tree bark, mud, and foliage
on the swamp floor, while paid assassins wear handmade,
orange dyed Gi for blending in with the leaves present 
throughout the treehouse-cities and markets of the Tashi.

Wild encounters include swamp monsters, like crocodiles,
large snakes, turtles, and venomous amphibians. While croc
hide is used rarely, the venom of the wildlife is used
very frequently in weaponry by the Tashi. 

Clothing of commoners is typically roughly tailored tunics,
robes, and shawls, with few distinct design characteristics.
Higher ranking soldiers and officials wear thin plates
of foreign metal in or over their armor as well, but some
Tashi are lucky enough to pan for the minerals needed.

The color pallete of the Enu-ah is largely yellow. 
splashes of green and brown on plantlife,
warm and soft oranges and rust colors on the characters,
bright oranges and reds on enemy characters.

The enemies are barbarians and lone foragers,
highwaymen and rogues. Engraged brutes or wily bandits.
soldiers of its cities include archers and 
spear or axe wielding soldiers.

The Outa'ah have warm dark skin, and jet black hair. Softer features characterize their
faces, they have less recessed eye sockets and thusly the token oriental facial structure.
A soft gaze is typical unless in battle or ceremony. Their clothing is largely determined by
the wildlife of that area, and adorning skulls and pelts is commonplace.

Their clothing is sparse on the body and indistinct, 
and armor is crude and minimal in design, only covering
portions of the soldier vulnerable to head-on attack, 
and often made of bone or ivory.

High ranking citizens adorn feathered headdresses in battle
and in their palaces. masks are worn by executioners and
more elite soldiers, priests and mercenaries.

less civilized areas are full of animals, 
scorpions and lions, rhinos and hippos.

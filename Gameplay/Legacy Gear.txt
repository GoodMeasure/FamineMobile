Legacy Gear is what will live on in a recently dead character's
inventory that will be obtainable by future reincarnations.

Characteristics of items deemed "Legacy Gear" include:
 - Weapons and Armor of Rare grade or higher
 - Keys, Documents, Maps, Scrolls, and Adventuring Gear
 - Rare crafting materials and class loot
 - Percentages of each currency. 

Legacy Gear will last between 1 and 4 generations*, 
factors that affect this duration include:
 - Population of town of death
 - Previous character phase, renown, and wealth

Pets and Familiars are also obtainable to new reincarnations,
and will last half the number of generations that the ancestor's
Legacy Gear did, rounded up. Their Loyalty will be reset.

 * All characters have the opportunity to pay for the
guaranteed delivery of all above items to next of kin in select
cities before death, at a rather steep, and rising price.

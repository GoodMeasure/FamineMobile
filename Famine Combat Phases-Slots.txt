A turn in Famine consists of choosing specific actions for each of a number of phases
Once the player has chosen an action for each phase, their turn will be carried out.

Actions fall into 3 categories:
-Basic Attacks - Red
-Spells/Technique - Blue
-Movement - Yellow

A phase slot may only allow actions that fall into one, two, or all three of these categories.
Items may be used in any phase.

the valid actions that can fill each slot will be denoted by the slot's color, or colors. For example:
-Basic Attacks or Spells - Violet
-Basic Attacks or Movement - Orange
-Spells or Movement - Green
-Any action - White
-No actions - Black

The player begins with only one action, or phase slot, to fill per turn.
This action can be any of the character's abilities.

Character's will gain additional actions per turn beginning in Phase 2, and then at each new phase.
Phase 0 - 1 slot(s)
Phase 1 - 1 slot(s)
Phase 2 - 2 slot(s)
Phase 3 - 3 slot(s)
Phase 4 - 4 slot(s)

A typical phase three character will have the phase line O-G-P, meaning:
In the first phase, the character can either move or attack.
In the second, either move or cast a spell.
third, either attack or cast a spell.

Enemies can affect your phase slots with abilities or debuffs.
